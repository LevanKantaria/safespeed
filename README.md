## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 🔐 Why does SafeSpeed need my location?
SafeSpeed uses your location to show accurate speed data and help you stay within legal limits. Your data stays on your device and is not shared.

### 🧭 My speed doesn't update accurately. What can I do?
Ensure you have a clear GPS signal and location permissions are fully enabled in your device settings.

### 🌐 Do I need an internet connection?
You need internet access for initial location and map data, but speed tracking may work with just GPS after that.
